# esports-for-engineers
Let's work together to maintain some of the best old engineering simulation games.  

This project provides a linux installer containing a free, award-winning sim or strategy game for each day of the week. The project began as a way to make daily exercise bike workouts more interesting by providing a daily eSport or mindsport for a complete mind/body workout.  To make this useful for engineers all over the world, it was decided to use only free programs that require no internet access.

Where to find top-quality hardcore strategy game software that is free?  Several classic MS Windows simulaton games are now free, and have been updated over the years with dozens of community-generated add-ons.  Unfortunately these sprawling old code bases are hard to install and do not work with the latest version of Windows. Bash scripting and statically linked wine containers solve these problems, providing for a one-step install of the whole 6 game package on linux.  This project's game collection contains carefully restored versions of classic racing and flight sims, as well as world-champion level bridge, chess and Go software.

Game screenshots, video clips and reviews are [here](https://alternativeto.net/software/esports-for-engineers/).  

To play the games, install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, download and unpack the [game tar file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/p6jkteimq89xjsm/esports-for-engineers-v40.tar.gz/file), install repository packages per the instructions, and run the launcher script.  If you want to discuss your game experiences or get suggestions about how to improve your scores, export your game report and submit it to the [forum](https://fosstodon.org/@esports_for_engineers) for commentary.
